I've recently decided to jump into the Laravel framework. I've just completed my Assoicate's Program at Broward College. A huge portion of that degree focused on server-side scripting. Wondering where to go next, I decided to jump into Laravel.

I'll be honest, I'm completely overwhelmed by the amount there is to learn. I've noticed some very interesting aspects in terms of keeping code clean and secure though.

I'm excited to update my progress and become more comfortable using the framework!
